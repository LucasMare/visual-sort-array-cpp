# visual-sort-array-cpp

Most important sorting algorithms of arrays shown visually

**About**

This program shows how some lines (with random heights) are sorting
 ascending with different sorting methods:
 
1.Bubble sort ;

2.Insert sort ;

3.Select sort ;

4.Insert sort ;

At the end of every sorting method, under all the lines, or the numbers are shown sorted. At the end of the input there is shown the time of every sorting method.
